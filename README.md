# L1L2-EthTester-v0.9
This is The begining of L1L2 tester. I started creating it at the end of 2021, had different versions of it before having of a working prototype.
At that time I had only ENC28J60 Ethernet controller, which was not quite well supported by ESP8266. Also I had to think about POE protection on the second port, so it took a lot of time.
After building tester with W5500 controller (you can view it https://github.com/RD-433/L1L2-EthTester-v1.0), I decided to finish this version too. 
Modifing some library files gave me positive result before, I didn't want to loose it. So I finished this version. 
Functionality is the same as int v1.0, the major difference is Ethernet controller.
